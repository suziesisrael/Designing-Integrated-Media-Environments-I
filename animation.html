							<p>In 2020, Diabetic Ketoacidosis (or DKA) was 2 1/2 times more likely in African Americans than their white counterparts. DKA can lead to coma or even death. Also, DKA in teens strongly correlates to suicidal thoughts and plans. </p>
                            <p><strong>Process description:</strong><br>
My main challenge was imagery -- since this is a nuanced topic, the images had to be culturally sensitive. My first attempt utilized emojo-like faces to represent the ratio of black to white incidences of DKA, and it had the effect of depersonalization and insensitivity. So I switched to photographs from Adobe Stock to make it more relatable. At the same time, I didn't want to make suicidal ideation about any specific group, so I used illustration to create an abstraction of someone experiencing it.</p>
                            <p>On the technical side, I used Adobe After Effects with various motion and opacity effects. The "drawing" was accomplished using a technique called "trim paths."</p>
