							<p>As the web designer for UF's CLAS Media Services, I get many requests for updating homepage banners. This screencast project was the perfect opportunity to create a video tutorial that would benefit my customers and save me time in the long run. </p>

                                <p><strong>The Process</strong><br>
                                I recorded myself on Zoom doing a demo for a customer, then clipped, edited, and re-recorded it to be more concise in Adobe After Effects. While the finished product is half as long as the original and infinitely more useful, I question the return on investment. First, my original recording was more playful and authentic, and I think authenticity is lost in the more concise version. More concerning, however, is the amount of time required (5 hours for a five-minute instructional video.) Another concern is the rapid technology change and how long this video will be useful.</p>
                                
                                <p>Regardless, the exercise was very valuable. I suspect it gets easier with more practice and planning, and I will use this video as a proof of concept. If it is well-received and saves my customers and me time and aggravation in the long term, I will carve out the time to make more videos.</p>
